# 📘 Sudan List Decoding of Reed–Solomon Codes
This project implements **Sudan’s list decoding algorithm** for Reed–Solomon codes over a finite field **GF(p)**, using **Python** and **SageMath**.
It demonstrates how to recover original messages from noisy codewords—even beyond the classical decoding limit.

---

## 📚 Background
Reed–Solomon codes are powerful error-correcting codes used in CDs, QR codes, and communication systems. They represent messages as polynomials evaluated over a finite field.

While traditional decoding can correct only up to a certain number of errors, Sudan’s algorithm goes further. It uses list decoding to return all possible messages that could match a corrupted codeword—even when more than half the symbols are wrong.

This project works over GF(257) to match ASCII values, and is based on the book:
📖 * Essential Coding Theory by Madhu Sudan and Atri Rudra - chapters 5, 11 and 12

## 🚀 How to Run
### 🔧 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- SageMath (must be available in your Python environment)
- `galois` library

### ▶️ Run the Code
